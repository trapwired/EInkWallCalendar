# EInkWallCalendar
Using a e-ink display from Waveshare (7.5 inch, 2 colors) and a pi zero w, I create a wall mounted calendar that displays the current week from an ics file.

# secrets.ini
In the root directory, there should be a file called secrets.ini, with the following content:
```
[Calendar]
link = https://some.link.to.a.calendar.ics.file
```
